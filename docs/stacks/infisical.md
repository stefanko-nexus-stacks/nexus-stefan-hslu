**Open-source secret management platform**

A modern, developer-friendly alternative to HashiCorp Vault:
- Beautiful, intuitive UI
- No unsealing required (unlike Vault)
- Environment variables sync to your apps
- Team collaboration with RBAC
- Audit logs for compliance
- Native integrations (Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD)
