**Landing page with dynamic service overview dashboard**

A beautiful, cyberpunk-styled landing page that dynamically displays all your Nexus services:
- **Dynamically generated** from `config.tfvars` during deployment
- Shows enabled services as "Online", disabled services as "Disabled"
- Animated grid background with scanline effect
- Direct links to all enabled services
- Service statistics (total, active, protected)
- Responsive design for mobile

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Default Port | `8090` |
| Suggested Subdomain | `info` |
| Public Access | Optional (can be your landing page) |
| Technology | nginx:alpine serving static HTML |

> ℹ️ **Note:** The info page is regenerated on every deployment. It reads your service configuration from `config.tfvars` and shows the current state of all services.
