> ✅ **Auto-configured:** Wetty connects to the server's SSH daemon using public key authentication only. Users must have their SSH public key configured on the server (same as regular SSH access).

> 🔒 **Security:** Wetty is configured with `SSHAUTH=publickey` to prevent password-based authentication. Only users with SSH keys configured on the server can access the terminal.

> 💡 **Usage:** Enable Wetty via the Control Plane when you need browser-based terminal access. It's disabled by default to reduce attack surface.
